##### Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to store code and the changes to that code over time in a way that allows you to track changes and undo them if necessary. This is really useful because everyone makes mistakes and version control is a way to track and isolate where a problem orginates, plus it allows a team to work together on a single codebase at the same time.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the main project that you can change without disrupting your existing code. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a command that tells git to record and save all the changes that you've indicated. A good commit message is detailed and explains what has changed

* What is a merge conflict?

It is when there are changes to one or more files that git doesn't know how to resolve.
