* Semantic tags relay context about the data within the tag both to the browser and to anyone modifying the html directly. Header and footer seem pretty useful because almost every page is going to need them.
* The browser uses the ordering of the html page, i.e. things at top go first 
*Snippets look really useful if I'm doing the same thing frequently. Just need to be sure and save them in the right place.
*Just understanding the role and context of the semantic elements, just from lack of exposure. There are lots of good references online.
