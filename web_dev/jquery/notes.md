
my plan is to run through the first parts of the code academy jquery course, find some youtube videos about learning jquery and try to see what other resources I can find online.

Working through the codeacademy stuff seemed to be the best use of my time, but honestly I think I would need to spend a bunch more time learning and actually using jquery to really get a handle on it.
